  <h1>The Life That I have</h1>
  <h2>
    by Leo Marks
  </h2>
  <p>
    The life that I have
    <br>
       Is all that I have
    <br>And the life that I have
    <br>
     Is yours
    <br>
    <br>The love that I have 
    <br>Of the life that I have
    <br>Is yours and yours and yours
    <br>
    <br>A sleep I shall have
    <br>A rest i shall have
    <br>Yet death will be but a pause
    <br>
    <br>For the peace of my years
    <br>In the long green grass
    <br>Will be yours and yours and yours
  </p>
